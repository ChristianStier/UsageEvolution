UsageEvolution
==============

The purpose of the ScaleDL Usage Evolution is to enable modelling of how the load and work of a system evolves over time.

ScaleDL Usage Evolution provides a thin modelling layer that expresses how the evolution of a set of variables applies to a usage model expressed in Palladio. The actual modelling of the evolution of a single variable (e.g. arrival rates or population in load or average video size in work) is done using the [LIMBO Load Intensity Modeling Tool](https://github.com/joakimkistowski/LIMBO).
